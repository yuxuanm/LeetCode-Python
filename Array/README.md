| :-----:| :----: | :----: |:----:| 
|1|[Two Sum](https://github.com/yuxuanm/LeetCode-Python/blob/master/Array/1.TwoSum.py)| Easy |use a dictionary can largely increase speed, but slightly increase memory|
| 11 | [Container With Most Water](https://github.com/yuxuanm/LeetCode-Python/blob/master/Array/11.ContainerWithMostWater.py) | Medium |use two pointers, move the pointer with shorter length|
| 15 |[3Sum](https://github.com/yuxuanm/LeetCode-Python/blob/master/Array/15.3Sum.py)| Medium |two pointers|
| 16 | [3Sum Closest](https://github.com/yuxuanm/LeetCode-Python/blob/master/Array/16.3SumClosest.py) | Medium | similar to question 15, two pointers, same idea|
| 18 | [4Sum](https://github.com/yuxuanm/LeetCode-Python/blob/master/Array/18.4Sum.py) | Medium | Similar to question 15 | 
| 26 |[Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://github.com/yuxuanm/LeetCode-Python/blob/master/Array/26.RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray.py) | Easy | Two pointers |
